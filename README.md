# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

This project is for Pewlett Hackard to get a list of all the employees eligibale for retirement,which can decide the future requried filled positions.
## Result
1.  I create a table, which summarize all the potential employyees that can be retired:
![retirement_titles](retirement_titles.png)
However, There are duplicate entries for some employees because they have switched titles over the years
2.  I remove these duplicates and keep only the most recent title of each employee:

3. I retrieve the number of employees by their most recent job title who are about to retire:
